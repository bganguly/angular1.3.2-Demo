# AngularDemo
Short angular example that demonstrates fetching data from a public api

# Goal
Create a web interface that helps you find a local restaurant based on cuisine type and location using either the Yelp API or Yahooâ€™s YQL API for local search.
At a minimum provide the following
- Allow searching by location
- Allow selection type of food (e.g. Pizza, Italian, Tapas, etc.)
- Allow sorting by rating or distance
Format the results as a list.

# How to run
This can be easily run locally even with a SimpleHTTPServer on the mac as follow.
- cd angularDemo
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8889
- navigate to localhost:8889/index.html
